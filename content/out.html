<div class="content"><div class="block">I've got to realize that little things like the --- above is sybolism.  That's a convention from Markdown, but it's also a generic way to show a break in thought.  It's easy to argue that it's structure.  What other things are there?

* Timestamp - That's a convention.  It may not always be present.  What if   it's in a different part of the document?  It will always make sense in   text, but it may be hard to find and parse reliably for a translator, a   process that molds the content into the structure.

* Title - This is similar to the timestamp.  It's probably near the same place   all the time, most likely separated with whitespace, but maybe not.  Both of   these are meta info about the document, not the actual document.

The simplest solution for including meta data would be to provide a meta section.  It would need to follow some type of convention, but it wouldn't need to be cryptic.</div><div class="block">title: Something Really Nifty author: Jeremy Greer date: Sun May 20 19:23:25 EDT 2018 - ---

You could argue that this is _not_ part of the content.  That is true, I guess, but then who else owns this info?  What if you found the content floating around the Sargasso Sea?  How would you know who made it and when it was made?  To that end, it would probably be a good idea to include a GPG signature to verify the content is authentic.</div><div class="block">I've been including a couple other Markdown inspired conventions here out of habit.  They're still meaningful in text, even when the reader doesn't know Markdown.  Plain text is allowed to have symbols.  We do all the time, like punctuation.  Hell, text is just a bunch of symbols.

To clarify, I guess we're looking at building transformers that can do the heavy lifting.  The author should not be concerned with conventions for the convenience of some future interpreter.  The onus is on the transformer to understand the content.</div><div class="block">I really like this idea.  It frees the content from worrying about structure conventions.  If there are conventions, the translator should be able to pick them up and work with them.  Any that get missed should end up as text and, assuming they had meaning in the text-only form, would still have meaning.</div><div class="block">One other aspect I can't account for is accessories that an author would like to include.  Initially, I thought of links and images, but those are really just references.  A link seems easy enough to find and convert to an anchor tag.  How would you handle an image, though?  It's just another url.  The translator could fetch it and check the file type or you could guess based on the url (check for an extension).  Maybe a contextual guess would work.

Or maybe you don't have to preemptively solve every possible problem before trying something out.  I just said above that it was the responsibility of the translator to interpret the content.

As a general rule of thumb, the content should always be able to stand alone. That's where the ideas and information reside.  All the rest is just different ways to display it.</div></div>
