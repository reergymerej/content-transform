# Trasnform Content

This reads plain text content and spits out html.  Like Markdown, but probably
not as good.  ;)

Actually, it's not quite like markdown.  This only concerned with interpreting
content's structure and generating another structure with the content folded in.

transform(content) => json
transform2(content) => html
transform3(content) => html with utility classes
