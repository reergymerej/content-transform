<div class="content"><section><p>I'm noodling over the problem.  It seems like it's a good idea in as much as you can be very expressive with the styles and insulate elements from unexpected CSS changes.</p><p>But what about this site?</p><p>I'm just starting this and I don't want to lock into a specific style.  The threat of that prevents me from adding content.  The actual article, this bit you're reading, should persist.

The problem really is just the separation of presentation and structure.</p><p>If we use really sparse class names in html, we'll need very complex CSS.  This is the angle all the pro-utility CSS people take.  This leads to doing all the design application in CSS, probably with an intimate knowledge of the structure. When structure changes in html, lots of work needs to be done in the CSS.  In summary, the HTML can be reused, the CSS cannot.</p><p>If we use utility CSS, there are no surprises when rendering html as you've explicitly said what you want to be applied in the markup.  This essentially is inline styles, but with the ability to use component class (think shareable mixins).  This keeps the CSS simple, if not redundant, and makes everything quite explicit.  The basic result is the CSS can be reused, but the HTML cannot.</p><p>Boiling the topic down, the real question is, which will be reused?</p><p>* HTML * CSS * neither</p></section><section><p>DRY use before reuse KISS separation of concerns premature optimization everything looks like a nail</p></section><section><p>If you step back, the issue is the cost of trying out something different.  If you buy in, how hard is it to undo?  Maybe this is another cool app idea.  What if there was a tool that allowed to you easily go back and forth?  Maybe a separate layer where you could apply a class name to an element either by name or by utility names?  Would that help?  It seems like being explicit is always preferred, but you'd need some sort of composition or currying or something to avoid the redundancy.</p><p>The compulsion for the one true solution is persistent.  I guess the real thing we need to do is understand the options, identify the pros/cons of each, and weigh those against the goals/constraints of the project.</p></section><section><p>I'm so enlightened.  All my answers are, "It depends."</p></section></div>
